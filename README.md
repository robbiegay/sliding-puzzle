# Robbie's Sliding Puzzle

A 4x4 sliding puzzle game!

## Getting Started

### Winning the game:
Use the mouse or arrow keys to move the tile pieces around the board. Click on any square adjacent 
to the "gray tile" to switch places with it. Pressing an arrow key will move the tile in the direction of the inputted arrow (ex. Left arrow will attempt to move the gray tile to the left). Repeat until you have put the puzzle in order. 
The gray tile will end in the top-right corner.

### Scrambling the puzzle:
You can scramble the puzzle manually by clicking tiles at random, or you can press the "scramble" button below the puzzle.

### Uploading an image:
Use the "choose file" button to upload your own image. Once your image has been uploaded, click "set img". You can then follow 
the above instruction for scrambling the board.

### Prerequisites

None.

## Running the tests

The biggest challenge was trying to understand how the objects containing the name and position of the tiles 
moved around the board. This really hurt my head.

* Abram (@Wildercat) for helping me with the "find" function, as well as helping to explain the File API to me.
* Taylor (@TaylorAkin) for telling me to not just randomize my board array on the random button. This saved me a lot of time as randomizing the array was my first thought.
